# Economics and Politics

One of the points I want to explore in this is that a highly evolved
(in the sense of "has been subject to a lot of evolution" rather than
"is good") social system which has coevolved with a symbiotic software
ecosystem is *incredibly complex*.

In particular the Byzantines would ask if maybe you could simplify it
down a bit.

As a result I don't know how the social system works exactly.

Here is what I do know:

## Political Organisation

The ship has a captain, who is an elected official that holds their
office indefinitely until an election is called by the crew.

There is also a hierarchy of deputies that the captain nominates,
the highest of whom is currently awake acts in lieu of the captain
when the captain is in suspended animation or otherwise indisposed.

On top of that at any given point there is a council of three people
the rotates quite regularly.

The number of people who have to ratify a shipwide decision is
complicated, but generally the concept is that as many people as
practical must ratify any shipwide decisions: The captain must always
ratify the decision (unless they decide to abstain), where practical
the council must ratify it (usually by a unanimous vote, though
in some circumstances a simple majority will suffice). If it's practical
for it to go to a ship wide vote, it does.

## The Vote Economy

The ship's primary currency is the voting share. This is usually shortened
to 'vote', though that is technically incorrect: The key voting
mechanism shipboard is *quadratic voting*. When a vote is to be made,
you may cast as many votes as you like (including a fractional number),
but this costs the square of the number of votes you want to cast. So a
voting share is only a vote if you cast exactly one. People routinely
ignore the difference to the point where it's semiofficial.

Everyone has an up to date and publicly visible balance of voting
shares they hold, and it is easy to transfer voting shares between
the two (and there are a number of internal markets and auction
systems).

The total voting share is fixed by the constitution. At any given
point a sizeable fraction is held in trust by the ship to pay for
the jobs that are required for the ship's functioning. Periodicially,
or triggered by certain events, if this share gets too high then it
is redistributed uniformly amongst the crew, and if it gets too low
then it is taxed progressively off people's assets.

The exact voting system used depends a lot on the decision, but the
most common one for day to day use is random ballot - a lot of trivial
decisions are put to vote (what music to play in the common room, what
meals to serve, etc).

The constitution enshrines what voting system should be used for almost
every circumstance, and provides a voting system for deciding what voting
system to use in cases where it is not otherwise clear.

At present there are 113 registered voting systems that can be used
in some circumstances, along with detailed tactical voting manuals for
each, but only 17 have been used in practice in living memory.

## The Resource Economy

The ship has a very large number of resources - computing power, water,
energy, various foods, bunk space, etc.

A certain fraction of each of these is the Captain's to dispose of
in a way they judge most beneficial to the wellbeing of the ship, and
each crew member is guaranteed an equal share of the remainder. The
exact mechanism of distribution varies from resource to resource.

These tend to then be subject to complex internal markets, with a great
deal of automated trading both from individual crew members and the ship,
which will frequently use the large retained fraction of the voting share
to act as a price setter by placing high bids to claim resources and then
either leaving them unused to reduce load on the system, gifting them to
specific individuals it needs to be active at specific times, or just
reselling them at a lower price.
