# The "Universal Translator"

It is widely believed that the trade fleet has some sort of automated
universal translation - they open their mouths and almost from the
beginning speak your language fluently. The only explanations are
a universal translator technology or witchcraft, and the crew only
visit cultures that think the second is more likely when things
have gone badly wrong.

Depending on context and interpretation this is somewhere between mostly
true and mostly false.

## Mostly True

The trade fleet of course have very good translation software. For any
language they have sufficient data for, it can produce extremely passable
translations which carry over the literal meaning very well, are reasonably
good at detecting idioms in the source language, will sometimes produce
idioms in the target language, and will generally produce something that
conveys more or less the correct meaning and is coherent and grammatical
if not exactly fluid.

Think of it as a highly polished version of google translate that also
does good speech recognition.

It tends to be much better at translations *to* the local trade dialect,
because the language has been refined over time to be relatively easy
to translate to and there's a vast amount of tuning and tinkering for
this use case. It's still pretty good at translating from trade to other
languages, and even between two non-trade languages it would still seem
almost magically good by 21st century standards (but is noticeably a lot
worse than a good human translator).

There is even reasonably good automated software that can take a large
corpus of text and audio from an unknown language and produce a good
translation model for it. It leans pretty heavily on the fact that the
system can match it to root languages that it knows more about, but even
with very little of that it can do quite a lot about inferring grammatical
structure, likely meanings of common words, etc. through brute force and
pattern detection if you give it enough data. It's unlikely it would
work on a completely unknown alien language, but if you were to give
the system the equivalent of a short novel written in any language they'd
seen an ancestor of that was less than about a thousand years prior it
can probably give you a translation model that is good enough to bootstrap
dialogue off.

When localising literature, TV, etc. to Crew dialect what typically
happens is that automated translation is performed then people
patch it with specific rules and corrections for it. Popular on board
works tend to have very soft translations as a lot of people have
contributed to them over time. For more niche works the translation
quality tends to be close to or entirely purely automated so is rather
weaker.

Some people find the automated translation lends a certain charm.
There is more or less permanent ongoing low level debate as to whether
Lesbian Space Pirates is better with the automated translation or the
curated one (neither produces a work that is very close to the original
in meaning because of the amount of gender politics that just doesn't
translate correctly at all). There are also a small core who insist
you have to view it in the original language to really get it, but
it's not a popular view.

## Mostly False

The reality is that the crew actually do just speak the local language
nearly fluently by the time they talk to you in it, and are learning
what they don't know faster than you can spot the gaps.

If you try to talk to someone through the universal translator then
they'll probably think you sound like an idiot, and it slows down
the dialogue substantially because every sentence has to be repeated
by the system (albeit usually in shorthand text form when translating
*to* Crew dialect).

Also, meeting someone for the first time and greeting them fluently
in unaccented and idiomatic speech in their language when you just
arrived in their star system is a ridiculously impressive feat that
will cause them to consistently overestimate your capabilities. This
is generally considered to be a good advantage to have.

The trade fleet will use their universal translators if they *have*
to, but mostly they don't have to because they have a far more
powerful technology they can rely on instead: A universal *language
teacher*.

This is essentially adaptive software that provides them with cues
while they're interacting in a language they're not fluent in. It
is designed to adapt to their language proficiency by providing in
vision cues about chunking other peoples' spoken sentences into
words, translations of unfamiliar words (both ones that have been
spoken recently and ones that from context the system thinks might
be useful), feedback on speaker's accent, corrections for any errors
(including incorrect use of idiom and accidental double entendres)
etc. It also helps with object tagging - for example, the contextual
cues for people include pronouns in the local language.
 
The idea of the software is that it's designed to phase itself out
as you get more fluent - it points out errors as you're making them,
but when it thinks you should know something it either delays showing
it to you or omits it altogether until you are obviously floundering.

Enough data for a known language or three is usually loaded onto
a Crew member's local network before they go planetside, and the
system can perform pretty well for getting a crew member up to
speed from zero in an emergency (watching an individual Crew go
from zero to apparently fluent in the course of a half an hour
conversation is almost *scarier* than them opening their mouth
and speaking fluently from the get go, but the crew find the latter
is a better opening move)

When people are going to contact a local culture they've typically
been receiving full immmersive language learning for weeks before hand
(exactly how long depends on how early in the process it is - first
impressions matter, but they're also when you have the least data,
so first contact tends to result in a much longer preperatory process).
This involves a lot of reading and watching of the local literature,
talking to eachother only in local dialect, etc.

Crew start learning languages early. It's impossible to be considered
a fully qualified crew member without speaking at least two languages
other than crew dialect (you don't have to be able to speak them without
the teaching assistant, but you *do* have to be able to speak them without
visibly relying on it to someone who doesn't have access to your
data feed). You're also not allowed planetside until you can do this
in the local dialect (some leeway is allowed for people who have a
known language disability, but they are still restricted from doing
so until after contact is very well established), so there's a really
strong incentive to do well at this.

Crew also have certain biological advantages in this: Most of them have
perfect pitch and a rather strong native aptitude for languages that
has been heavily selected for over generations. They
also have access to powerful drugs which enhance memory formation
(long-term use of these is a bad idea, but taking them for a week
while you fast learn the basics of a language is fine).

## Translation Conventions

## Names

The general rule for translating names is:

1. If the name doesn't have any meaning in the source language,
   it is preserved verbatim.
2. If the name has a significance that is easy to translate into
   crew dialect then it is.
3. If the name is untranslateable into crew dialect, or is difficult
   to translate without losing nuance or concision, it is imported
   as a loan word.

In the English translation of Crew dialect the convention is the
same, so any fidelities of the source language are preserved. This
may result in things that are loan words in crew becoming normal
english phrases (Lesbian Space Pirates being a prime example of this
- there's really no way to say this in normal Crew dialect)

## Pronouns

In languages with more complex pronoun situations than Crew dialect
has, the system assigns pronouns to crew members and they are added
to the contextual cues along with everything else.

The general convention is to default to a universal pronoun where it
would be harmless to do so, and if not look for status significance
to pronouns and then match that to the status significance they want
the locals to assign to people - when talking to a patriarchal
society with gendered pronouns the captain and the heads of the
trade delegation will be he, when talking to a matriarchal one
they will be she.

When pronouns are rank attributed the convention is to to pick
a consistent crew pronoun that is the highest they think they
can get away with.

Beyond status signifers the goal is to try to assign pronouns so
they match the local distribution but are otherwise at random,
with some attempt to match different local dialects consistently
so that two people don't reverse status depending on what language
you're speaking.

This sometimes causes significant confusion when there are multiple
local cultures and languages with different gender politics and/or
legacy gender in their languages. Usually it's explained away as a
translation error (which is technically correct) and the crew
sheepishly swap programs
