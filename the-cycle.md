# The Cycle of History

System-bound civilizations fall. It's considered a sociological inevitability at this point.

Sometimes they fall because of a plague, or an asteroid, or some other disaster beyond their
capacity to deal with, but even if they're lucky and escape all those the end state of civilization
is collapse.

## The Fall of Civilizations

The enemies of civilization are growth, coordination problems, and optimization.

The speed of light and energy barrriers mean that your civilization more or
less has to sustain itself based on what's available in system.

Thus any civilization that wants to grow will do so until it hits the resource constraints of the
local system. There are only so many easily accessible resources within access, after which
you are reduced to mining stars and gas giants. These have abundant resources but are rather
a lot harder to mine, and once you've mined them it's very energy intensive to use nuclear
alchemy to turn what you got out of them into something useful.

So, at some point growth grinds to a near standstill compared to the rate of what used to
be possible.

Some civilizations are deliberately cautious and limit growth *before* they hit this point.
Those civilizations tend to last longer.

However large the civilization grows, they run into certain hard physical limits: The speed
of light and the density of civilization. There are strong incentives to centralize as many
things to within a few light seconds of each other, and limits on how many people (AI or
human) you can easily fit in that.

Sometimes civilization groups around multiple centers - e.g. some systems have multiple
habitable planets.

Others group around a single center, which becomes a single point of failure.

Once a resource plateau is hit, and if the civilization has survived to this point, one
of two things happens:

* Resource war! Nukes fall, almost everyone dies. This happens basically 100% of the time
  when you've got more than two major population centers, and most of the time when you've
  got only two.
* The local civilization somehow manages to overcome their coordination problems (the more
  people they have at this point the harder this is) and shifts over to a post-growth
  economy.
  
Post-growth economies fall prey to the final trap of civilization: Optimization.

When you have a fixed set of resources you tend to optimise your usage of them as much as
possible. There are lots of local pressures to do so, and it just tends to happen over
time.

Unfortunately highly optimised systems tend to be highly *fragile* systems. You optimise
for the common case, even when you don't mean to, and because you're operating fairly close
to the set of available resources the ability to adapt to black swan events becomes worse
and worse over time, and eventually one comes along that your civilization can't handle
and the whole system spirals out of control.

*Usually* enough people survive that the civilization reboots itself and you get a new
one emerging out of the ashes. Often they manage to do it even without restarting from
a medieval level - the problem is at this point well enough known that even the most
well optimised civilization will usually have caches designed to help with this - but
it's rarely a smooth process and sets the civilization back hundreds of years (and generally
the less damage your crash does the less time it takes before the cycle repeats).

## Exceptions

### The Trade Fleet

The obvious apparent exception is the trade fleet, but they're not really.

This is partly because the trade fleet is not a self-sustaining civilization: It relies
entirely on being able to find a suitable local manufacturing base. They can just about
make it three interstellar voyages without local repairs, but by the second one they're
going to be panicking a bit.

Also, individual trade ships *do* crash and burn. They're also fairly vulnerable to the
optimization trap. But because of the self-reproducing nature of the trade fleet, the
overall fleet goes on and tends to select over time for more robust social models.

Finally, on the time scales of a crash, most trade fleet ships haven't been arround long
enough to experience one because of the amount of time they spend in between stars - if
you count thing by the average timeline of a ship member, most ships are only a couple of
generations old, which is shorter than the cycle of most crashes.

### The Slow Planets

Some planetary civilizations try really hard to limit growth from very early on. They
tend to last a fair amount of time because of this.

The main problems they tend to run into are:

* Other systems want to colonize them to "properly make use of their resources". In general
  invading another star system is a non-starter, but if you notice that that system barely
  has the resources to defend itself against two star ships, let alone a couple dozen, it
  suddenly becomes very appealing.
* the Trade Fleet tends to avoid them, because they don't have much to offer, which tends to
  reduce their robustness significantly because they have much less access to outside knowledge.
  
Additionally, they're relatively rare for a fairly simple reason: Systems with large industrial
capacities and populations tend to launch a lot more colony ships, so the cultural evolution
of the human race strongly selects for that behaviour.

## Reasons for hope

The length of time between crashes trends ever upwards over time.

Some of this is the trade fleet continuing to pass on knowledge between the planets and people
slowly figuring out what works.

Some of this is just the right behaviours being selected for - more cultural artifacts and
colonies tend to come out of civilizations that last longer, so the right behaviour tends
to propagate over time.

Whatever the root cause though, the length of time between industrialisation and fall has
more than tripled since old earth. The hope is that in a petasecond or two people may even
have figured out how to end the cycle of collapse. In the meantime, the trade fleet keep
preserving knowledge and passing it on between civilizations between restarts.
