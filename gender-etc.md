# Gender, sexuality, etc

Note: All of this is particularly undecided and may change as it becomes
plot relevant.

Trigger warning: If you have strong feelings about gender this might be a
bit triggery. The society described is not really less oppressive than our
own, it just oppresses different things.

## Gender

The Eschaton Arbitrage more or less has a policy against considering gender
to be a thing. The dialect they speak explicitly lacks gendered forms of words,
and most forms of personal expression through appearance (regardless of whether
we would perceive them to be gendered) are socially discouraged.

Some people do end up wanting to express themselves more and adopt jewelry,
clothing, mannerisms, etc. that they pick up from visiting planets or historical
archives. They will never be explictily censored for it, but people will sometimes
take them aside and talk to them about how it's not really appropriate and
shouldn't they have outgrown that sort of thing by now?

The causes of gender dysphoria are generally quite well understood and careful
regulation of hormone balances in the uterine regulator (natural births don't
happen shipboard - everyone has an implant suitable to their plumbing
that prevents them) plus genetic screening are enough to prevent it entirely.
As a result, where people want to express a gender it tends to be through
personal choice rather than the result of a disorder.

First generation crew often come from planets who have more traditional
approaches to gender (and often more broadly accepting ones than those
abard the Eschaton Arbitrage, as places with strong and different opinions
about gender tend to be put off joining). Usually there is enough pressure
to conform and prove that they're as crew as any other that they if anything
go overboard on the lack of gender expression, sometimes up to or including
elective surgery.

Appearance wise most people from the Eschaton arbitrage tend to parse as
slightly androgynous female (regardless of any mundane details of what
genitalia they might possess), which often leads to a certain amount of
confusion from local cultures.

One planet they visited made a VR serial about them whose name roughly
translates to "Lesbian Space Pirates". The crew were *extremely* confused
by this, but it has achieved something of a cult following on board mostly
because of it being about equal parts completely baffling and absolutely
hilarious.

## Sexuality

Sex is regarded much the same way as gender: You could, but best not.

A consequence of on ship medical practices is that individual hormone levels
and sex drives are under fairly conscious control, and the default is set for
asexuality. People are entirely free to set it to a higher level if they want
to, and maybe a quarter of the crew do, but it's generally considered to be
something rather childish that you're supposed to grow out of (despite this
having relatively little basis in what people actually do - the ages of people
with their sexuality, ahem, turned on are more or less uniformly distributed
across the spectrum, the older people just are a bit more circumspect because
they get disapproved of more).

Either in spite of or because of the general lack of sexuality, crew aboard
the Eschaton Arbitrage are extremely touchy feely and tend to be very casual
about physical contact and nudity. This often causes confusion when visiting
planets or when interacting with other trade fleet vessels from a different
lineage. Most people who casually observe them tend to assume that the ship is
basically a non-stop orgy.

## Romance

It happens, but tends to be polyamorous and the lines between friendship
and romance are often quite blurry.

## History

This didn't come about all at once and is largely the result of a culture
that values conformity and cohesion and frequently engages in deliberate
social and genetic engineering to achieve that. Over time people have voted
to change the defaults, and a lot of differences have been eliminated by
ships forking: When a crew splits off to form new ships, the crews are
often allocated in such a way as to increase conformity among the two
(or more) ships.

It's worked out pretty well for them in achieving those goals, both because
it removes some sources of internal tension and because it rather effectively
sets them apart from most system bound culture they encounter, which helps
foster an increased sense of unity.

These behaviours are by no mean unique amongst the trading fleet. It goes
back a number of generations in Eschaton Arbitrage's lineage and it has
proven to be a particularly successful lineage so is comparatively common
in local space, but they still routinely encounter other traders that
behave radically differently.
