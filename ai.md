# Artificial Intelligence

The following are the rules for AI in this story (I consider them to be plausible
rules for how things would work in reality but not necessarily true. For the
sake of the story they are true):

* Sentient AI is possible, and can be made at or slightly above the upper end of human intelligence.
* Godlike superintelligent AI is not possible. There are fundamental scaling limits
  for intelligence.
* Copying an AI with fidelity is hard to impossible - they tend to end up depending quite
  sensitively on specific quirks of their architecture and putting them on a new architecture
  tends to cause them to rapidly diverge.
* AIs run very badly on architectures optimised for general purpose computing - it's not
  *impossible* to make them run on an arbitrary machine, but it tends to require at least
  and order of magnitude more resources than it should and they don't run at full speed.

## What happens when you make an AI?

* There is no singularity per se, certainly no hard take off one.
* But it tends not to go very well for the society in question due to complex and
  not very well understood social dynamics. Sentient AIs tend to be a harbringer of
  the end times, and societies where they are widespread tend to destabilise and
  collapse within a generation.
* The AI and automation rarely lasts much longer than a few centuries after the
  collapse of the civilization that built it: The relative cost and complexity of
  maintaining an AI means that there are enough parts in the pipeline for producing
  it that it really needs a large industrial base with a sentient workforce to keep
  an AI running indefinitely. The numbers mostly end up not working out for AI
  only civilization, and the hard crashes that tend to come for human civilizations
  with AI in them tend not to lead to an infrastructure that can support them afterwards.

## Trade Fleet Attitudes to AI

Official trade fleet policy is that when you encounter a sentient AI you adopt
the following procedures:

1. Immediately shut down, quarantine and flag any software you have bought from
   this system. Dump all physical goods where possible. If the local system has
   made modifications to your ship, cut as many of them out with a hacksaw as you
   can without interfering with step 2.
2. Get all your crew back on ship as quickly as possible and then bug out of the
   system at maximum acceleration, pausing only to leave a monitoring and warning
   buoy broadcasting outsystem for other trade fleet vessels to hear.

This is arguably more paranoid than is strictly necessary - fears of super hacking
AI are mostly unfounded - but ship lineages that implement policies with less fear
of AI have a tendency not to outlive their first 500 years or so, which means
this policy is as close to universal within trade fleet as you get.
